Given the requirement to use 3 message passing strategies all 3 strategies were applied starting with Rest, then gRPC then Kafka.

To help with speed of delivery, the UdaConnect monolithic architecture, with three domains of person,
connection and location were refactored in separate Restful based microservices.

A new location endpoint exposed via gRPC was implemented to pass data to Kafka which will be responsible for persisting data in the database.
This could help with scale since its likely we would always be receiving location data during a conference. Kafka lends itself nicely to real-time
streaming, which is great for this use case.
