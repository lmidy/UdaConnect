Location Producer has one method Create.

This endpoint allow a client to create new location messages.

To call the create method run:

python modules/location-producer/writer.py

Note given this current architecture design you must have:
 - the gRPC server running (main.py)
 - as well as Kafka location topic created
 - zookeeper should be running
